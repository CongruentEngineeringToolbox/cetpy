        `CaseRunner` objects are not picklable due to decorators (idk what

        object to other thread and make a copy there.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cr_args
            Dictionary, that contains all information, needed to create (almost)
            copies of original `CaseRunner`. Every worker has own `CaseRunner`,
            because these objects have internal state and thus can't be shared
            between processes.
        cases
            Pandas `DataFrame` with cases to compute in "direct" mode. The idea
            is to generate cases in original process, split them in equal parts
            and pass to worker processes. This is not exactly efficient, but
            splitting ranges and generating cases in each process would result
            in gaps in design space (as far as I understand).
